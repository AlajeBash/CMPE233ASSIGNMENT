		As the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) evolves, technological applications and initiatives are
		multiplying in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease, treat patients and take the pressure off
		overworked healthcare workers, while also developing new, effective vaccines. At a time when
		everyone needs better information, including epidemic disease modellers, state authorities,
		international organisations and people in quarantine or maintaining social distancing, digital
		information and surveillance technologies have been unleashed in an unprecedented manner to
		collect data and reliable evidence to support public health decision-making.
		There are so many type of Technologies like; 
		<ul>
			<li>Blockchain Technology</li> 
			<li>Aartficial Inteligence (AI)</li>
			<li>Telemedicine</li>
			<li>Telehealth </li>
		</ul>

		<strong>Blockchain</strong> is a powerful technologies and can help in providing better data and help people better understand 
		their situation. As the world contends with the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, officials battling 
		the pandemic need tools and valid information at scale to help foster a greater sense of security 
		for the public. As technologists, we have been heartened by the prevalence of projects such as Call 
		for Code, hackathons and other attempts by our colleagues to rapidly create tools that might be able 
		to help stem the crisis. But for these tools to work, they need data from sources they can validate. 
		For example, reopening the world’s economy will likely require not only testing millions of people, 
		but also being able to map who tested positive, where people can and can’t go and who is at 
		exceptionally high risk of exposure and must be quarantined again.
		One of the main problems the clinicians, scientists and researchers studying the data behind the 
		crisis say they are facing as they try to map and contain the crisis, is lack of integration of 
		verified data sources that can be used with confidence. While there are lots of reputable sources 
		researchers can turn to like the figures from the Center for Disease Control and the World Health 
		Organization, and others, much of the data being communicated among hospitals and government agencies 
		or public/private partnerships is inconsistent, or it can’t easily be shared.
		IBM has been engaged by purpose-driven entities like <a href="about_hacera.html">HACERA</a>
		who have meaningful projects like <a href="about_the_product.html">MiPasa</a> 
		that are designed to have impact on the outcomes during this time of crisis.</p>

	<h2 class="subheading">WHAT IS COVID-19?</h2>
	<p>
	<strong>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</strong></br>
	Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 
	and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill 
	and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions 
	like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more 
	likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously 
	ill or die at any age.</br>
	The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease 
	and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre 
	apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based 
	rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</br>
