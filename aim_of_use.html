	As the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) evolves, technological applications and initiatives 
	are multiplying in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease, treat patients and take 
	the pressure off overworked healthcare workers, while also developing new, effective vaccines. 
	At a time when everyone needs better information, including epidemic disease modellers, 
	state authorities, international organisations and people in quarantine or maintaining 
	social distancing, digital information and surveillance technologies have been unleashed 
	in an unprecedented manner to collect data and reliable evidence to support public health 
	decision-making</br>
	Blockchain applications Like <strong>Mipasa</strong> is used because of it features that 
	are objectives whose focused on solving some of the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19
	pandemic, including:
	<ul>
		<li>Enable trusted sourcing and sharing of verified healthcare-related datasets from 
		multiple global sources for streamlined access by the growing number of research teams 
		around the world.</li>
		<li>Providing the infrastructure for privacy-preserving digital mechanisms that enable 
		anonymous sharing of information without leaking personally identifiable information 
		(PII). This allows test-sites, healthcare facilities, and other care providers to 
		report their data without fear or favor, knowing that their privacy will be protected 
		by sophisticated privacy mechanisms.</li>
		<li>Using the data to build a global reporting system to track the spread of the virus.
		Using this reporting system, it may be possible to pinpoint new hot spots and help 
		individuals determine if they have been close to those potentially exposed. 
		Better tracking of the movement of the virus enables better preventive measures.</li>
		<li>Providing analysis and trends of global impact based on the data shared by all 
		the sources.</li>
		<li>Verifying legitimate medical tests, therapeutics, vaccines, and authentic medical 
		supplies and pharmaceuticals, while using blacklisting to weed out the fakes.</li>
	</ul>
